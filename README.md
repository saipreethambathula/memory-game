Memory Card Game

A fun and interactive Memory Card Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Flip the cards, match all pairs, and test how sharp your memory is!

Overview

The Memory Card Game challenges players to remember the positions of cards and find matching pairs. Each round is randomized to ensure a unique experience. The player’s goal is to complete the board in the fewest moves and shortest time possible.
